texlive-dummy-opensuse
======================

This is a "dummy-package" which achieves the dependencies of the openSUSE TeX Live packages without installing the real files. This makes it possible to install the original TeX Live distribution (http://www.tug.org/texlive/) without the overhead of the openSUSE packages. The "dummy-package" provides scripts in "/etc/profile.d/" for setting the correct pathes of the TeX Live binaries (you should use the default installation path "/usr/local/texlive/"). After installing a new-year "dummy-package" uninstall the previous one.
